<p>
	Hederis, Inc. ("Hederis," or "we" or "us" or "our") recognizes the need to protect the privacy of the personal information you provide to Hederis with respect to your access and use of our website <a href="http://hederis.com/">hederis.com</a>, and related services (collectively, the "Website").
</p>
<p>
	Therefore, we have adopted this privacy policy (the "Privacy Policy"), which sets forth, among other things, the type of information that will be collected, the purpose and use of the collected information, and your rights with regard to the collected information. This Privacy Policy governs how we collect and use your personal information wherever you use our Website. By accessing the Website, you are consenting to the collection and the use of your information by us, but only to the extent described herein. Should you wish to revoke your consent, you may do so by contacting us, information on which is set out in the Privacy Policy below.
</p>
<p>
	Hederis may make modifications, deletions and/or additions to this Privacy Policy ("Changes") at any time. Changes will be effective: (i) thirty (30) days after Hederis provides notice of the Changes, whether such notice is provided through the Website user interface, is sent to the email address associated with your account or otherwise; or (ii) when you opt-in or otherwise expressly agree to the Changes or a version of this Privacy Policy incorporating the Changes, whichever comes first.
</p>
<h2>
	Protection of Your Information
</h2>
<p>
	We are accountable for the information in our custody. Therefore, when we collect or use your information, we will utilize commercially reasonable safeguards to ensure its protection. It should be noted that no security procedure is currently 100 percent effective. Should any breach of your Personal Information occur, we will inform you as soon as reasonably possible, as required by applicable law.
</p>
<h3>
	Type and Purpose of Collection
</h3>
<p>
	We collect information at various points in the Website to facilitate its use by our users. Specifically, two types of information are collected:
</p>
<ol start="1" type="1">
	<li>
	<strong>Non-Personal Information:</strong>
	Upon accessing the Website, certain non-personal information will be automatically collected without your knowledge or consent, such as your IP address, location data (which is anonymous and where you log in through the Website you will be asked if you consent to the Website accessing your location, which can be updated at any time in your device settings) and the referring website ("Non-Personal Information"). We use Non-Personal Information to examine our traffic and to view how our customers use the Website. This type of information will not allow you to be personally identified although we might be able to associate it with your account. For example, we use "cookies," which contain only certain statistical information. For more information on cookies please find more information below.
</li>
<li>
	<strong>Identifying Personal Information:</strong>
	If you initiate a transaction through the Website, we may collect and store information about you, such as your name, phone number, address, email, and credit card information, as well as any other information you provide to us ("Personal Information"), in order to process your transaction, send communications about them to you, and populate forms for future transactions. This information may be shared with third parties for the same purposes. Hederis does not disclose your Personal Information to third parties for the purpose of directly marketing their services to you unless you first agree to such disclosure.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
	Additionally, Personal Information may be used and disclosed to the extent Hederis may deem reasonably necessary to enforce the terms of any agreement between you and Hederis, or to protect the rights, property, or safety of any person or entity.
</p>
<h2>
	Withdrawal of Consent
</h2>
<p>
	You may withdraw your consent to the collection of Personal Information at any time by sending an email to us. Upon receiving notice that you have revoked your consent, we will stop using your Personal Information within a reasonable time, which will vary depending on what information we have collected and for what purpose. Please note that we will send you an email confirmation upon receipt of your request. Therefore, if you do not receive a confirmation email, please contact us again with your request. If you do choose to withdraw such consent, your access to the Website may be diminished, or your ability to choose some of the options on the Website may be limited.

<h2>
	Sharing Information
</h2>
<p>
	We will not sell, rent, or disclose to outside parties the information we collect and save except that we may share the collected information with other parties as follows:
</p>
<ol start="1" type="1">
	<li>
		<strong>Affiliated Service Providers:</strong>
		We have agreements with various affiliated service providers to 	facilitate the functioning of the Website, with whom we may share the 	information we have collected. For example, we may share your credit 	card information with the credit card service provider to process your 	purchase. All administrative service providers that we use are required to have the same level of privacy protection as we have, and therefore 	we expect that your information will be handled with the same level of 	care that we employ. Additionally, for example, we may use analytic 	services.</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Where required by law:</strong>
		We may share the collected information where required by law, 	specifically in response to a demand from government authorities where 	such demand meets the legal requirements.</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Statistical Analysis:</strong>
		We may share Non-Personal Information and aggregated information with 	third parties, including but not limited to for advertising or 	marketing purposes. No Personal Information will be shared in this 	manner.</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Transactions:</strong>
		In connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, financing or acquisition, or in any other situation where Personal Information may be disclosed or transferred as one of our business assets.</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Businesses on Hederis:</strong>
		We may share information from or about you (such as your age and gender 	and how you use the Website) with businesses listed on the Website. </li>

</p>
<h3>

	We are based in the United States, which is where all of your data will be processed.
</p>
<h3>
	Data Security
</h3>
<p>
	We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorized way, altered, or disclosed.

</h3>
<p>
	We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements. To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements. In some circumstances you can ask us to delete your data. In some circumstances we may anonymize your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.
</p>
<h2>
	YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS UNDER THE GDPR
</h2>
<p>
	Under certain circumstances, EEA residents have rights under data protection laws in relation to their personal data. If you are an EEA resident, you have the right to:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<strong>Request access </strong>
		to your personal data. This enables you to receive a copy of the 	personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully 	processing it. </li>
	<li>
		<strong>Request correction</strong>
		of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us. </li>
	<li>
		<strong>Request erasure</strong>
		of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove 	personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to 	process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your 	personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to 	object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your 	information unlawfully, or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons 	which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your 	request. </li>
	<li>
		<strong>Object to processing</strong>
		of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or 	those of a third party) and there is something about your particular 	situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground 	as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You 	also have the right to object where we are processing your personal 	data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate 	that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information 	which override your rights and freedoms. </li>
	<li>
		<strong>Request restriction of processing</strong>
		of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the 	processing of your personal data in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data's accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us 	to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to 	establish, exercise, or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it. </li>
	<li>
		<strong>Request the transfer</strong>
		of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you. </li>
	<li>
		<strong>Withdraw consent at any time</strong>
		where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, 	this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out 	before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may 	not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will 	advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent. </li>
</ul>
<p>
	If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please contact us. You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive, or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances. We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response. We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.
