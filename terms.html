</p>
<p>
	TO THE FULL EXTENT PERMISSIBLE BY LAW, HEDERIS DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. HEDERIS DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE WEBSITE, PRODUCTS, INFORMATION, CONTENT, MATERIALS, OR OTHER SERVICES INCLUDED ON OR OTHERWISE MADE AVAILABLE TO YOU THROUGH THE WEBSITE OR ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS SENT FROM HEDERIS ARE FREE OF VIRUSES OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS.

</p>
<h2>
	8. Dispute Resolution and Arbitration
</h2>
<p>
	In the interest of resolving disputes between you and Hederis in the most expedient and cost effective manner, you and Hederis agree that every dispute arising in connection with these Terms of Service will be resolved by binding arbitration. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited (if any) review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. This agreement to arbitrate disputes includes all claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of these Terms, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether a claim arises during or after the termination of these Terms. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND HEDERIS ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS, COLLECTIVE, OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION.
</p>
<p>
	Despite the provisions of the preceding paragraph, nothing in these Terms of Service will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit the right of either party to: (a) bring an individual action in small claims court; (b) pursue an enforcement action through the applicable federal, state, or local agency if that action is available; (c) seek injunctive relief in a court of law; or (d) to file suit in a court of law to address an intellectual property infringement claim.
</p>
<h3>
	Arbitrator
</h3>
<p>
	Any arbitration between you and Hederis will be settled under the Federal Arbitration Act, and governed by the Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, "AAA Rules") of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"), as modified by these Terms, and will be administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at	<a href="http://www.adr.org">www.adr.org</a>, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by contacting Hederis at <a href="mailto:legal@hederis.com">legal@hederis.com</a>.
</p>
<h3>
	Notice; Process
</h3>
<p>
	A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other party by certified U.S. Mail or by Federal Express (signature required) or, only if such other party has not provided a current physical address, then by electronic mail ("Notice"). Hederis's address for Notice is: Hederis, Inc., 2035 Sunset Lake Rd. Suite B-2, Newark, DE 19702. The Notice must: (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought ("Demand"). The parties will make good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if the parties do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Hederis may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Hederis must not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any. If the dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor, Hederis will pay you the highest of the following: (i) the amount awarded by the arbitrator, if any; (ii) the last written settlement amount offered by Hederis in settlement of the dispute prior to the arbitrator's award; or (iii) $1,000.
</p>
<h3>
	Fees and Procedure
</h3>
<p>
	The parties to the arbitration shall each pay an equal share of the costs and expenses of such arbitration, and each party shall separately pay for its respective counsel fees and expenses; provided, however, that the arbitrator may award attorneys' fees and costs to the prevailing party, except as prohibited by law. If you commence arbitration in accordance with these Terms of Services, Hederis will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for more than $10,000, in which case the payment of any fees will be decided by the AAA Rules. Any arbitration hearing will take place at a location to be agreed upon in Portland, Oregon, but if the claim is for $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted: (a) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; (b) through a non-appearance based telephone hearing; or (c) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address. If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In that case, you agree to reimburse Hederis for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator must issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator's ruling on the merits.
</p>
<p>
	The arbitrator may grant injunctions and other relief. The arbitrator shall administer and conduct any arbitration in accordance with the law of the jurisdiction in which the dispute arose, including civil procedure rules, and the arbitrator shall apply the substantive and procedural law of the jurisdiction in which the dispute arose. To the extent that the AAA Rules conflict with local law, local law shall take preference. The decision of the arbitrator shall be final, conclusive, and binding on the parties to the arbitration. The parties agree that the prevailing party in any arbitration shall be entitled to injunctive relief in any court of competent jurisdiction to enforce the arbitration award.
</p>
<h3>
	No Class Actions
</h3>
<p>
	YOU AND HEDERIS AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR MEMBER OF ANY CLASS, COLLECTIVE, OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING except that users may bring a proceeding as a private attorney general, if and as allowed by law. Further, unless both you and Hederis agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. Nothing in this Agreement infringes upon any rights a User may have under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, including any rights prohibiting compulsory arbitration.
</p>
<h3>
	Modifications to this Arbitration Provision
</h3>
<p>
	If Hederis makes any future change to this arbitration provision, other than a change to Hederis's address for Notice, you may reject the change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to Hederis's address for Notice, in which case your account with Hederis will be immediately terminated and this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the changes you rejected will survive.
</p>
<h3>
	Enforceability
</h3>
<p>
	If the "No Class Actions" section is found to be unenforceable or if the entirety of this Section 8 is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Section 8 will be null and void and, in that case, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 9 will govern any action arising out of or related to these Terms of Service.
</p>
<h3>
	Right to Opt Out of Arbitration
</h3>
<p>
	You may submit a statement notifying Hederis that you wish to opt out and not be subject to arbitration under this section. Should you desire to opt out, you must notify Hederis of your intention to opt out by submitting a written notice, which may be via email to <a href="mailto:legal@hederis.com">legal@hederis.com</a>, stating that you are opting out of this section. In order to be effective, your opt out notice must be provided within thirty (30) days of your agreeing to these Terms. Should you timely opt out of this section, you may pursue available legal remedies and will not be required to arbitrate claims.
