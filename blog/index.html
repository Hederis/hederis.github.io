            <p class="date">Published 2020-07-29</p>
            <p>We have pulled the lever! The Hederis App is now available outside of beta testing.</p>

            <p>There are many new features in the app that are different from previous versions of the program. If you only worked with Hederis:Convert in the past, this release of Hederis is a new creation! (If you tried out Typeset, this release should be somewhat familiar, but with even more features.)</p>
            <p>Here are a few things we want to highlight:</p>
            <p>There are 6 main areas that you’ll work with for every project:</p>
            <ul>
            <li><p>Your home base for each project is your Dashboard. This is where you’ll start your project off by uploading your Word document into the program. The Dashboard is also where you’ll find your file downloads (PDF, EPUB, Kindle EPUB, HTML, and updated Word documents). You can also set your printer PDF settings on the Dashboard (like trim marks and gray scaling), and import a design template to get started. You can also make named backups here (for example, to save a snapshot of your files as they existed when you sent them off for their first-pass review).</p></li>
            <li><p>Edit Info is where you can update your project metadata, and Settings &amp; Invites is where you can add collaborators to your project, and restore your project text from a named backup.</p></li>
            <li><p>In the Edit Text pane, you can edit the document text and review the coding/tagging used for each paragraph.</p></li>
            <li><p>You can use the Compare Text function to see how your text has changed between different manuscript versions, any edits you’ve made in the Edit Text pane, or even the text that appears in the EPUB or PDF.</p></li>
            <li><p>The Design pane is where you’ll really dive in to customize your design template (or build a design from scratch), preview each laid-out page and make adjustments, preview your ebook, and handle all your line-break and page-break needs. </p>
            <ul>
            <li><p>You can use the Design pane to customize your book design even if you’re using a template.</p></li>
            <li><p>You can create “page template” master pages and format them with all the elements you are used to, like page numbers, book title, author name, and chapter title.</p></li>
            <li><p>In “Sections &amp; Text” you can customize each paragraph style with decorative elements, drop caps, fonts, leading, and borders. You can also limit your paragraph customizations to only certain instances of that paragraph style (e.g., the first paragraph that follows a chapter heading).</p></li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            </ul>
            <p>We’ve also introduced some new concepts:</p>
            <ul>
            <li><p>Locking is a new layout feature that allows you to “lock” your line breaks and page breaks into place. This is something that many automation tools are lacking, and makes it easier for you to work with page layouts within an automated workflow framework. For example, you might lock your chapters before sending the PDF out for proofread, so that your text doesn’t reflow before you get the edits back from your proofreader (thus negating all of their work). It can be a little confusing to wrap your head around at first, so we definitely recommend reading the documentation!</p></li>
            <li><p>For those who have never worked with Styles before (either in Word or in InDesign), this may also take some getting used to. “Styles” are basically just a more advanced way of tagging your book text (e.g., marking which paragraphs are titles, or extracts, or plain text, etc.). You can read more about how we use styles in Hederis in our documentation. You can review and adjust styles in the Hederis Word file, or you can use the Edit Text pane right in Hederis to review each paragraph (and you can also edit text, add new paragraphs, move paragraphs around, and more—read more about it in our documentation). </p></li>
            <li><p>Because we’re using real, clean HTML and CSS behind the scenes, we can take advantage of that to allow you to target your designs to specific paragraphs depending on where they occur in a chapter (for example, create a unique design only for paragraphs that are inside an extract, or remove the indent from the first plain text paragraph in a chapter), without needing to create custom style names for each variation. We lovingly call these “sub-selectors” (though in the app, you’ll find these options in the “Limit these changes to” menu inside “Sections &amp; Text”).</p></li>
            </ul>
            <p>Finally, check out the sample workflow diagram we put together in our documentation. This is a walkthrough of what a real publishing production workflow might look like using Hederis.</p>
            <p>We hope this email has been informative and that we’ve piqued your curiosity. Look out for more to come in the future and know that if you have any questions, we are just an email away.</p>

            <h3 id="press-release-07-29">Press release: Tech startup launches cloud-based bookmaking program for trade publishers.</h3>
            <p class="date">Published 2020-07-29</p>
            <p>[Portland, Oregon, July 29, 2020] – Hederis, Inc., a tech startup creating software for trade publishers, has launched their AI-supported book design app.</p>
            <p>The Hederis app is a collaborative cloud-based program&mdash;meaning editors, designers and project managers can easily access the latest version of a book’s text and design throughout its production cycle.</p>
            <p>What makes this app stand out is the speed with which a user can create a high-quality book layout without the need for coding experience. Made specifically for books, Hederis combines automation and hands-on layout tools, so that users can create laid-out books with the click of a button using the Hederis design templates, or create their own design and adjust the layout of each page in the book.</p>
            <p>After a successful Kickstarter campaign in 2018, early book prototypes were built using Hederis. Over 500 copies were printed for more than 190 campaign backers. Hederis began beta testing the software in 2019, with partners Erewhon Books. Together they produced Erewhon’s first title (THE FORTRESS) just before COVID, with 6 more titles currently ramping up production. </p>
            <p>About the company:</p>
            <p>Hederis is redesigning automation for human intervention. We believe publishing tools should be accessible and efficient for everyone. </p>
            <p>For more information, please see: <a href="http://hederis.com">Hederis website</a>.</p>
            <p>###</p>
            <p>To request a print or eBook sample, or to arrange an interview with CEO and Founder Nellie McKesson, contact <a href="mailto:nellie@hederis.com">nellie@hederis.com</a>.</p>

            <hr />

            <h3 id="newsletter-07-22">We are launching the app!</h3>
            <p class="date">Published 2020-07-22</p>
            <p>We are so grateful for your support during the Beta Testing phase of Hederis' development. Your feedback and insight into how you work and what features you need has been instrumental in our creative process. Our goal with Hederis has always been to make automation more accessible for editors, designers, and production managers, and with your help, we’ve reached the first milestone of that goal.</p>
            <p>For a long time this kind of technology has been reserved primarily for ebook formatting and coding, and we’ve worked so hard to create something that can work for print designers and ebook publishers alike. Bookmaking is a collaborative process, and we hope that our centralized book files and tools will take your collaboration even further!</p>
            <p>On Wednesday, July 29, 2020, Hederis will be live. Here’s what this means for you (read on for more information about pricing and billing):</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Any books that were actively in production during the beta period will remain free, forever. (“Actively in production” means that you’ve uploaded a Microsoft Word manuscript at least once.)</li>
              <li>For new projects, you’ll be billed the first time you upload a Word manuscript for conversion.</li>
              <li>We’re also offering a free project to every new user of the app, and we don’t want you to be excluded. If you’d like a free project, please email us at info@hederis.com and we’ll send you a discount code to give you 100% off of one project.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Here are some of the things you can do in Hederis, as part of this release:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Edit and tag text right in the app, and sync those edits to the laid-out pages</li>
              <li>Prevent reflow in finalized print pages</li>
              <li>Create reusable design templates that you can share between projects</li>
              <li>Upload your own fonts and configure who can use them</li>
              <li>Automatically translate print designs to ebook-friendly layouts (or create your own ebook design templates, for more control)</li>
              <li>Make a snapshot backup of your files at any point, and restore to that snapshot state as needed</li>
              <li>Create a group to manage sharable templates, billing information, fonts, and more</li>
              <li>Visually preview your print pages and adjust line breaks and page breaks</li>
              <li>Visually preview the digital design and adjust as needed</li>
            </ul>
            <p>… and lots more!</p>
            <p>Does this mean we’re done working on the app and adding new features? No way! While we feel that we’ve gotten to a solid point and are ready for this release, we’ll be continuing to update and improve our app, with feedback from users like you. We also have enough tech experience to know that there will always be bumps in the road with these kinds of releases, which is why we’re offering free support to all users during our launch period (including the in-app chat support coming soon!).</p>
            <p>While all of this is exciting for our team, it is also impossible to ignore the circumstances that publishers are facing during this pandemic, and the systemic racial inequality and injustice that both our country, the world, and our industry are reckoning with. Launching this app, and especially deciding on prices, has been exceedingly difficult in a time when everything seems so up in the air.</p>
            <p>We have no desire to lose your partnership in this transition, so please contact us if you are finding the progression from Beta Testing to Partnership burdensome email us at—info@hederis.com. We are also offering special reduced cost options to support BIPOC publishers—email us to learn more!</p>
            <p>Some important things to note:</p>
            <p>Billing occurs the first time a manuscript is uploaded for conversion. Group owners can set all projects within a group to use the same billing information. For enterprise billing options, contact us at info@hederis.com. 
            You can find all of our pricing information on our website.
            The app will go live Wednesday, 7/29 at noon EDT.</p>
            <p>We’ve poured all our love for book publishing into the app we’ve built, and we’d love for you to help us spread the word, and share with folks who might benefit from our tools. Hederis was built by publishing professionals, for publishing professionals, and we hope that we can all keep growing together.</p>
