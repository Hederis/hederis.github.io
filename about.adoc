* *Help you succeed.* While we’re doing our best to build tools that we think can help the publishing community, our tools aren’t the right answer for everyone, and that’s ok. We’re always happy to help point you in the right direction and get you on the path to success.
* *Support our community.* Embracing innovation can feel lonely, but rest assured you’re not alone. We’re genuinely passionate about book-making and love to share our knowledge and connect with other like-minded folks.
* *Respect your knowledge and experience.* Book-making is a craft that has evolved over centuries, and involves a variety of different people with different skills. Newcomers and veterans alike have invaluable insights to share, and we want to hear them!
